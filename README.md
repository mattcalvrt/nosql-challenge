# nosql-challenge
This repo uses PyMongo to read, update, and perform exploratory analysis on a MongoDB database. The database consists of food hygiene rating data from the UK Food Standards Agency for various establishments across the United Kingdom. This project analyzes that data through a three step process:
1. Database and Jupyter Notebook set up
2. Database updates
3. Exploratory analysis

Location of files and folders:
- JSON file containing the data that was imported to MongoDB : Located in the ***Resources*** folder
- Jupyter notebook file for initial database setup and updates: ***NoSQL_setup.ipynb***
- Jupyter notebook file with analysis: ***NoSQL_analysis.ipynb***
